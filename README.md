# Uncover

Create [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/) presentations
from a single Markdown source.

There are two modes of operation for Uncover:

1. Server mode
2. Export mode

The server mode is used primarily for the purposes of getting a live
preview while working on authoring a presentation and is very similar
in functionality to the excellent
[reveal-md](https://webpro.github.io/reveal-md/) project. Uncover
differs in that it (will be) more focused on being able to export
slides to static HTML which can then be used on any computer without
needing Node or presentation build dependencies installed.
